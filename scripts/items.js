/*
    This script will allow you to inject a feature option into the game that will allow you to
    change the physical and mental modifiers for the Declasse system. 
    When selecting a feature, you will be able to select a physical or mental modifier addition based on your
    character's attributes.

    This will be put under the details tab of the character sheet.
    The feature will be called "Declasse Settings and Effect the rolls".
